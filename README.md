In my project, I created user class methods. Using 
'User' class, you can create user objects, with its user id, name, surname, email, password, birthdate, and get information about your user. In addition, it is possible to get information about 
user's age.

'UserService' class is created to add existing user to 'users' dictionary, find them in the dictionary, delete and update them, and get data about the amount of students in the 'users' dictionary.
In order to use these methods, you need to call them using the class name 'UserService', since it is class methods.

'UserUtil' class is the class with staticmethods. Here, you can generate user id and password, check if the password is strong, generate and validate emails.
In order to use these methods, you need to call them using the class name 'UserUtil', since it is class methods.
